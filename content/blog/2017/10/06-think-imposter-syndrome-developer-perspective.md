I created this video because I was inspired by the talk of Jessica Rose that she gave at the <a href="https://fronteers.nl/congres/2017" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fronteers Conference 2017</a>! Unfortunately, the video of this talk is not online yet, <a href="https://youtu.be/wtrF5C7Gv7E" target="_blank" rel="noopener">but this is the talk of a few years ago</a>.

Her talk It was so relatable! And I wanted to share a few things from what I learned from it, and a few additions from my own!

<h2>Experiencing an Imposter Syndrome?</h2>
To be honest, every developer has that feeling of not deserve to do this work or not being good enough! After 8 years, I have that same feeling sometimes! It doesn't matter how much years experience you have!

I'm wondering if you have that same feeling as I do? And how do you live with it? How do you go through these hard feeling?
