In the **second episode of**Mr**Frontend Motivation Talk **I want to discuss the way people try to learn JavaScript by JavaScript frameworks. But in my opinion that is not the way to make it easier for yourself! Instead, you're gonna make it more difficult. Especially if you run into errors.

I hope this episode will give you to courage to dive into Vanilla JavaScript!

If you have topic requests for the next episodes, please put them in the comments! I would be very happy to help you stay motivated in becoming a better developer.

Enjoy!
