## A year of the Mr Frontend Community

I wanted this week started more personally to thank you all!

This month we reached 1 year of the Mr Frontend Community! :-D

We reached a lot of people with help and support for Frontend Development, 232 wonderful persons. I 'm very happy that a lot of them are highly active and keep on contributing to the community! I hope that this coming year we can stay helpful to a lot of others who didn't discover us yet.

Our community has not only Frontend Developers! There are graphic designers, backend developers, web designers and a lot of other titles. We are lucky to have all kinds of levels in experiences with a lot of different backgrounds. The members of the community are coming from India, VS, Netherlands, Germany, Turkey, Africa and a lot more other countries (sorry if I did forgot yours! If so? Add them in the comments).

I'm very thankful for this experience to start this wonderful community with so many nice people!

So this week our¬†Mr¬†Frontend weekly sharing include links with WordPress, JavaScript, CSS and a lot of other things.

I hope you¬†like it! If you have things you missed in the list, feel free to add them in the comments üòâ
