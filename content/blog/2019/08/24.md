Give yourself credits for everything you have learned last days, weeks, months or even years! Just see often how much you have been grown!

Most of the time people say donâ€™t look back, but in the case to be aware of what you already achieved you have to look back.

It is good to document these things for yourself.  Make a list for yourself what you have learned last month or week, and write it in a tweet or blog post.

If you donâ€™t have a blog, we would love to publish it on the Mr Frontend blog ðŸ˜‰. And if you like Twitter more, than just post it there!

## Example Tweet:

> Iâ€™m so thankful to learn all these awesome things this month!
> 
> âœ… Loop over DOM elements with JavaScript
> 
> âœ… Build a layout with Flexbox
> 

It is so easy to forget where you are coming from, but let us remind ourselves to all the lessons we have learned so we can inspire others to do the same.
