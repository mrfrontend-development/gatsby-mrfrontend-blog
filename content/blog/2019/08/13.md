Donâ€™t feel guilty when you pause your path of learning to code! Or when you're not having a high pace of learning! Your brains need some air to evaluate everything you learn in order to apply it.

Letâ€™s be honest, learning to code is awesome! But it can also cost you a lot of energy! Even though your body is not doing physical exercises, your brains definitely doing the hard work.

Just like your body needs time to gain energy after doing workouts, so does your brain!

If your doing #100daysofcode be careful with information overloading your brains. So donâ€™t feel guilty if you need some days off.

You're just taking care of yourself by doing that! Otherwise burning out can be around the corner. I think we want to prevent that right ðŸ˜‰
