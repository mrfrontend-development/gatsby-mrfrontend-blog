Wondering how you could use the JavaScript Fetch API? In this practical video I'll show you how you can do it by yourself.

The Fetch API is a new and more powerful replacement of the XHR, fully async and Promise based. ðŸŽ‰

## Code example

<iframe width="100%" height="500" style="border: 0; background-color: #ccc" loading="lazy" src="https://stackblitz.com/edit/javascript-fetch-api?ctl=1&embed=1&file=index.js&hideExplorer=1&hideNavigation=1"></iframe>

If you ask me, you can read the fetch makes more sense, since you can read in order which steps it takes. If you want to read more in detail how to use the Fetch API, Mozilla has a great resource on that.
