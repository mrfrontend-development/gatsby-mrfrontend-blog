The Frontend Workflow! I've got a lot of questions, about how I have setup my workflow for Frontend Development. I thought I could tell you, but it is better to show you.

This is the first episode about NPM, NodeJS, GulpJS, Bower and Git. There will be more episodes the next coming weeks. In this video, I show how to install all the tools I use for my workflow. I did this screencast on a mac, but on a windows machine will also work (almost) the same.

If you have any questions or comments, please post them in the comments!

This is the first screencast I created, so it was really exciting to record. So if you have some feedback for me to make better screencasts, I would love to know them.
