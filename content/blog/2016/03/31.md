This is the second episode of  the "Frontend Workflow" series. In this episode, I will use GulpJS, some plugins and Browser-sync to show you how you can automate your CSS development in your workflow.

The first episode I showed you in a video [how you need to install tools like NPM, NodeJS, GulpJS, Bower and Git](https://mrfrontend.org/2016/03/frontend-workflow-1-npm-nodejs-gulpjs-bower-git/). So if you missed episode 1 of the "Frontend Workflow" series, I recommend watching that first.

I'm looking forward to all the responses! And don't forget to enjoy this journey to be a much better and effective Frontend Developer :-)

  > Hi! It would be great, if you could post the code you are using. Otherwise we always have to type it in with our hands...
