## Frontend Development

1. [**ESTIMATING A FRONT END WEB DEV JOB**](https://hanserino.github.io/2016/02/11/estimating-a-front-end-web-dev-job/) _Let’s be damn honest here. Estimating is for most of us the worst part of our job. We didn’t sign up for this. They didn’t teach us this in school. But if you get it right it will make your life so much better. There’s nothing worse than screwing up an estimation and having to deal with either not making a deadline, going over budget, working late hours to patch it up and so on.._
2. [**Personal branding for Junior Frontend Developers**](http://blog.mrfrontend.nl/2016/03/personal-branding-junior-frontend-developers/) _Personal branding is not just a hype! It can help to grow your career as a Junior Frontend Developer. With personal branding, I mean how you show the world, what you do, what you like, what you love the most etc. etc._
3. [**Generate HTML, CSS straight from Sketch using Protoship**](https://medium.com/sketch-app-sources/code-generator-to-create-react-projects-straight-from-design-with-clean-html-and-css-c399a8189f0d#.a26zzsdd5) _Protoship is a code generator for designers and front-end programmers that create HTML, SASS, and React components from a Sketch design.

I’m doing CSS related projects for a while now and every time I need to start a CSS project from scratch I think: “This time I need to do it right.”_
2. [**Sass wat?**](https://medium.com/@umayr/from-the-plains-of-css-to-the-mountains-of-sass-6e9f586bbc78#.7jl5cwrdm) _Yet another introduction to Sass._
3. [**Trello CSS Style Guide**](https://github.com/trello/trellisheets/blob/master/styleguide.md) _Writing CSS is hard. Even if you know all the intricacies of position and float and overflow and z-index, it’s easy to end up with spaghetti code where you need inline styles, !important rules, unused cruft, and general confusion. This guide provides some architecture for writing CSS so it stays clean and maintainable for generations to come._
4. [**Guides & Tutorials for Sass**](http://thesassway.com/guides)
5. [**Centering in CSS: A Complete Guide**](https://css-tricks.com/centering-css-complete-guide/) _Centering things in CSS is the poster child of CSS complaining. Why does it have to be so hard? They jeer. I think the issue isn't that it's difficult to do, but in that there so many different ways of doing it, depending on the situation, it's hard to know which to reach for._
