If you are new web development one of the first things you start with is HTML. HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language.

## Hypertext

Hypertext is text wich contains links to other texts. This is also one of the basic elements of HTML. I hope you already know how to create a "hypertext link".
If not, you could better start reading the basics of HTML before continue reading this post.

## Markup

To describe parts of a document we use tags. There are many tags available and you should choose them wisely to give sense to your document.

Read more about the available tags at [http://www.w3schools.com/tags/](http://www.w3schools.com/tags/)
