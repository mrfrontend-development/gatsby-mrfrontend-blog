4. **[Automating Your Front-End Workflow With Yeoman 1.0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iUQ1fvdO9GY)** _Writing a modern web app these days can sometimes feel like a tedious process; frameworks, boilerplates, abstractions, dependency management, build processes..the list of requirements for a front-end workflow appear to grow each year._
5. **[Paul Irish, "JavaScript Development Workflow of 2013"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7AU2Ozu8eo)** _From the Fluent 2012 conference: The past two years have given us a wealth of tools and editor innovation that makes developing web apps more fun and certainly more productive.

## Source control

1. **[Git - the simple guide](http://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/)** _Just a simple guide for getting started with git. no deep shit ;-)_
2. **[Git for Designers](https://medium.com/@dfosco/git-for-designers-856c434716e#.9xm5m7u53)** _How it works When you use Git, your project lives in a repository. Every project is a repository, and every repository has a different history - basically, a timeline of every change you saved in it. However, Git doesn't save changes to the history automatically. To save a change to your history, you need to commit your changes._

## CSS & Sass

1. **[Why I becoming Sassy](https://medium.com/@brenolf/why-i-m-becoming-sassy-8b4fe456558c#.2enp0zgp3)** __When it comes to CSS preprocessing, there is always someone asking which should they pick. This yields an avalanche of discussion between people fiercely defending their favorite one just like a Lilliputian would definitely not agree with a Blefuscuian’s penchant for breaking their boiled eggs on the larger end. Actually, it all boils down (no pun intended) to personal preferences. However, there are some subtle and not-that-subtle features in Sass that led me into it, forsaking my old friend LESS.__
2. **[Medium’s CSS is actually pretty f***ing good.](https://medium.com/@fat/mediums-css-is-actually-pretty-fucking-good-b8e2a6c78b06#.vtyul8bya)** _I always believe that to be the best, you have to smell like the best, dress like the best, act like the best.

3. **[Mixins Better for Performance](http://csswizardry.com/2016/02/mixins-better-for-performance/)** _When it comes to preprocessors, one of the most frequent questions I’m asked is<q>Mixins or?`@extend`</q> I’ve always been quite vocal about this topic, and I firmly believe you should avoid `@extend` for a number of reasons._
4. **[Position a child div relative to parent container in CSS](http://www.webdevdoor.com/html-css/css-position-child-div-parent)** _One of the common CSS techniques that can be a bit tricky at first is being able to absolutely position a child div element within a parent div container, relative to the parent. There are numerous scenarios where you might require this sort of positioning for div and other HTML elements._
5. **[Atomic Design Pattern](http://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/)** Atomic design is a methodology for crafting effective design systems
6. **[BEM your CSS](http://slides.com/raymonschouwenaar-1/bem-your-css#/)** The more levels your selector has, the more time it takes to reach your element and can apply the style. The more levels your selector has, the more difficult it is to debug.
7. **[Advice to budding front-end developers](http://csswizardry.com/2014/08/advice-to-budding-front-end-developers/)** I receive a lot of email from younger/junior developers asking me for advice on how to get into the industry, how to make a name for themselves, and how to make it as a professional front-end developer.

## JavaScript

1. **[ReactJS Conf 2016](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLb0IAmt7-GS0M8Q95RIc2lOM6nc77q1IY)**
2. [**Quick Tip: How to Create and Manipulate Arrays in JavaScript**](http://www.sitepoint.com/quick-tip-create-manipulate-arrays-in-javascript/)_The `length` property of `Array` objects is one that many who are relatively new to JavaScript do not understand. Many mistakenly believe that the length tells you exactly how many entries there are in an array whereas this is only true of some arrays. Some beginners do not even realize that `length`is a writable property of arrays. To clarify just exactly how the `length` property works, let’s take a look at what happens when we either change its value ourselves or run something that updates the array that also results in the length changing._
3. **[What are the best client-side JavaScript module loaders?](http://www.slant.co/topics/1089/compare/~webpack_vs_browserify_vs_requirejs)** _Compare Browserify, Webpack, and RequireJs___
4. **[Draft.js - Rich text editor framework for ReactJS](http://facebook.github.io/draft-js/)** _Draft.js is a framework for building rich text editors in React, powered by an immutable model and abstracting over cross-browser differences.__Draft.js makes it easy to build any type of rich text input, whether you're just looking to support a few inline text styles or building a complex text editor for composing long-form articles._
5. **[10 Tips for Writing JavaScript without jQuery](http://tutorialzine.com/2014/06/10-tips-for-writing-javascript-without-jquery/)** jQuery is a great library. It came to be around the time when IE6 was the number one browser. Back then, there were quirks and differences that were tedious to work around and jQuery was the perfect tool for writing cross-browser code.
