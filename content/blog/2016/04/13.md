This is episode #4 of the “Frontend Workflow” series. In this episode, I used GulpJS, JShint, Gulp-jshint and Browser-sync to show you how you can automate your error checking of you JavaScript code in your Frontend development workflow.

This is one of the things that helps me, avoiding JavaScript on live/online website's and web app's. So I definitely recommend you to watch the video and use JShint in your own Frontend Workflow!

If you got stuck with the error checking or got error's in your JavaScript you find hard to debug/fix, please add them in the comments or share it in our [**Slack Community**](https://mrfrontend.slack.com/) (make sure your [register for free](http://mrfrontend.org/)).

If you missed the other episodes of the “[Frontend Workflow](https://mrfrontend.org/category/workflow/)” series, I recommend to check them out before you watch this episode.

For this video, I’ve created a [Presentation on slides.com](http://slides.com/raymonschouwenaar-1/frontend-workflow-4-automatic-javascript-error-checking-with-gulpjs/) and I have placed [the code on Github](https://github.com/mrfrontend-development/frontend-workflow-4-automatic-javascript-error-checking-with-gulpjs) so you can check everything back there.

In the coming episode, I'm gonna show you, how to automate more in your Frontend Workflow.
