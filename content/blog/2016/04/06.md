This is episode #3 of  the “Frontend Workflow” series. In this episode, I used GulpJS, Gulp-sass and Browser-sync to show you how you can automate your Sass development in your workflow.

If you missed the other episodes of the “[Frontend Workflow](https://mrfrontend.org/category/workflow/)” series, I recommend to check them out before you watch this episode.

For this video I've created a [Presentation on slides.com](http://slides.com/raymonschouwenaar-1/frontend-workflow-3-sass-automation-with-gulpjs/#/) and I have place[the code on Github](https://github.com/mrfrontend-development/frontend-workflow-3-sass-automation-with-gulpjs/) so you can check everything back there.
