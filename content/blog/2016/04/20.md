This is episode #5 of the “Frontend Workflow” series. In this episode, I used Git to show how you can keep your project safe with Github or Bitbucket.

Github and Bitbucket are powered by Git. It doesn't matter if you work on a personal project, or on a project with a big team. Git is gonna help you keep your code safe, but as keep track of all your changes. Who did some great work or broke the application.

Git is the essential thing to learn in the Frontend Workflow! If you have questions about Git, Github or Bitbucket? Please add them in the comments below or contact us in our [**Slack Community**](https://mrfrontend.slack.com/) (make sure your [register for free](http://mrfrontend.org/)).
